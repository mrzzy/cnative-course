# Cloud Native/Containers - Practical
Practical for Workshop on Containers with Docker

## Intro
In this practical, we will apply the container know how we learnt by:
- use Docker to containerize a web backend application.
- use Docker to containerize a web frontend application.
- use Docker Compose hook up the containers to allow them to work together.
    - use a pre-built docker image to provide a database to the backend.
- deploy the stack on a Google Cloud server.
